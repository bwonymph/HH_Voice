# Hedera_Voice

Hedera Voice is a simple way for anyone to publish a message to Hedera Hashgraph using the Hedera Hashgraph Consensus Service (HCS).

The Voice script automatically generates a Hedera Hashgraph account, a HCS Topic and sends your voice (message) to the topic on the Hedera Hashgraph mainnet. 

Your HCS message can be found on the Hedera Hashgraph mainnet from account ID on a block explorer

The script can be modified to continue using the Hedera Hashgraph account to create new topics, or send messages to same topic.
